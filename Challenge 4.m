//Based on the previous question, imagine that you have a class called Vehicle and an object called myVehicle that could be either Car, Motorcycle, or Boat. Suppose that you write the following:
//
//[myVehicle prep];
//[myVehicle getGas];
//[myVehicle service];
//Do you see any advantages of being able to apply an action to an object that could be from one of several classes?

// The advantage is that the Vechicle class is able to retain the common elements of Car, Motorcycle, or Boat.  So that Car, Motorcycle, or Boat doesn't have to have redundance properties when you write their classes.
